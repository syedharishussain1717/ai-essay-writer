# 📝 AI Essay Writer

A simple Streamlit web app that uses the **Groq API** to write a short, well-structured essay on any topic you give it.

Built as a beginner-friendly project: tested in Google Colab, deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.

## How it works

1. You type a topic (e.g. *"climate change"*) and pick a length.
2. The app sends your topic to Groq's `openai/gpt-oss-20b` model.
3. The AI writes an essay with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, shown right on the page.

## Tech stack

- **Python**
- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io)** — web interface
- **[Groq API](https://console.groq.com)** — AI text generation
